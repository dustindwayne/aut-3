# 12. Glossary — AUT-3

**AUT-3**  
Volumetric photonic compute–memory architecture replacing CPUs, GPUs, RAM, and storage.

**DWDM**  
Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing. Assigns memory/compute roles by wavelength.

**Voxel State Vector**  
Multi-component optical state at each 3D coordinate.

**Compute Pulse**  
<100 fs Blue/UV pulse performing nonlinear operations.

**3D Read Array**  
Multi-angle photodiode readout for tomographic reconstruction.

**Z-Gating**  
Optional depth-selective write barrier for safety or redundancy.

**Digital Shell**  
Minimal electronic layer for sequencing, sensing, and I/O.

**Tomographic Reconstruction**  
Rebuilding a 3D optical state from 2D projections.

**Spectral Roles**  
Mapping of memory/compute functions to specific wavelength bands.

**Volumetric Compute**  
In-place, region-wide optical computation across a 3D medium.

**Mesh Node**  
A single AUT-3 cube that can join arrays for scaling.

**Wavelength Locking**  
Feedback system that adjusts emitter wavelengths to compensate refractive drift.
