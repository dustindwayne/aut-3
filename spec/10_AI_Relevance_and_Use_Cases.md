# 10. AI Relevance and Use Cases — AUT-3

AUT-3 naturally aligns with AI workloads because both are:
- tensor-based
- high-dimensional
- parallel
- nonlinear

The architecture replaces GPU and TPU devices with direct volumetric optical
compute.

## 10.1 Tensor Operations

Blue/UV compute pulses implement:
- tensor multiplies
- matrix multiplies
- contractions
- convolutions
- activation functions via nonlinear media response

All occur volumetrically and in parallel.

---

## 10.2 Model Storage

Large model weights reside in:
- mid-depth Green (active weights)
- deep Red/IR (static weight archives)

Models no longer require VRAM or host RAM.

---

## 10.3 Inference Acceleration

AUT-3 accelerates inference by:
- eliminating memory transfer
- performing in-place tensor updates
- leveraging femtosecond optical operations

Inference becomes a spatial optical transform.

---

## 10.4 Training Acceleration

Training benefits from:
- massive volumetric parallelism
- immediate weight update locality
- field-based gradient transformations
- zero-copy in-volume updates

---

## 10.5 Associative Memory

The volumetric medium acts as:
- a continuous attractor space
- high-dimensional memory
- optical Hopfield-like behavior

---

## 10.6 Multi-Node AI Scaling

Mesh arrays act as distributed tensor systems with:
- optical inter-node communication
- shared spectral conventions
- distributed field operations

---

## 10.7 Non-AI Use Cases

Beyond neural networks:
- physics simulations
- volumetric rendering
- holographic reconstruction
- encryption via optical transforms
- real-time scientific compute

---

## 10.8 Summary

AUT-3 is optimized for AI workloads by nature of:
- spectral-layer memory semantics
- femtosecond nonlinear compute
- in-place tensor transforms
- volumetric parallelism
