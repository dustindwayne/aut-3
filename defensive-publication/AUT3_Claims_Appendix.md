## 1. Independent Claims

### **Claim 1 — Volumetric Photonic Compute–Memory Apparatus**

1. A computational apparatus comprising:
   - a volumetric optical medium having a three-dimensional distribution of
     voxels, each voxel storing a multi-component optical state vector;  
   - a plurality of wavelength-specific emitters configured to project optical
     energy into said medium;  
   - a tomographic readout subsystem comprising multi-angle, multi-wavelength
     photodiode sensors configured to reconstruct said optical state vector;  
   - wherein said apparatus performs computation and memory operations directly
     within said volumetric optical medium using wavelength-selective
     interactions.

### **Claim 2 — Wavelength-Defined Functional Roles**

2. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein distinct wavelength bands perform distinct
   functional roles, comprising:
   - a storage band in the Red/Infrared region;  
   - a working-memory band in the Green region;  
   - a compute band in the Blue/UV region.

### **Claim 3 — Femtosecond Compute Pulses**

   Blue/UV pulses of duration less than 100 femtoseconds.

### **Claim 4 — Closed-Loop Wavelength Locking**

4. The apparatus of claims 1–3, wherein a control subsystem detects refractive
   index drift in said medium and dynamically retunes emitter wavelengths to
   maintain alignment with designated absorption peaks.

### **Claim 5 — Unified Compute–Memory Operation**

5. The apparatus of claims 1–4, wherein computation occurs in-place upon memory,
   such that no external CPU, GPU, or RAM devices are required.

### **Claim 6 — 3D Tomographic Readout**

6. The apparatus of claims 1–5, wherein the readout subsystem reconstructs
   three-dimensional state via multi-angle projections acquired from photodiode
   arrays.

### **Claim 7 — Optional Z-Selective Gating**

7. The apparatus of claims 1–6, further comprising one or more Z-selective
   gating layers configured to restrict write or compute operations to specific
   depth ranges.

### **Claim 8 — Meshable Node Architecture**

8. The apparatus of claims 1–7, wherein a plurality of said volumetric
   photonic apparatuses are interconnected into a mesh that forms a distributed
   compute fabric.

13. The apparatus of claim 7, wherein the Z-gating layers are electrochromic or
    liquid-crystal-based.

### **Claim 14**
14. The apparatus of claim 8, wherein nodes share synchronized wavelength
    reference clocks.

### **Claim 15**
15. The apparatus of claim 5, wherein logical data structures including scalars,
    matrices, and tensors map directly to regions of the volumetric medium.

### **Claim 16**
16. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the tomographic readout is non-destructive.

### **Claim 17**
17. The apparatus of claim 1, wherein the digital shell performs orchestration
    functions without executing compute instructions.

### **Claim 18**
